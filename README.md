# Day 2 – Text Preprocessing

This notebook demonstrates the preprocessing pipeline for the Spam Classifier project.

## Steps Covered
1. **Stop-word Removal** – Eliminates common words that add little meaning.
2. **Tokenization** – Splits text into individual tokens/words.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Converts text to numeric features based on word frequency and importance.
4. **Train/Test Split** – Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
